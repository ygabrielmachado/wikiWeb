	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>
		Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike
		Krieger.[12] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which
		had become a popular feature among its users.[13][14] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of "instant
		camera" and "telegram".[15]
	</p>
	<h4>
		2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding
	</h4>
	<p>On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz
		while working on Burbn.[16] Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[17] Shayne Sweeney
		joined in November as an engineer,[17] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August
		2011.[17][18]</p>
	<p>
		The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 PM on July
		16, 2010.[19][14] Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later
		at 9:24 PM. It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the
		alphabet in its URL.[20][21][better source needed] On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially
		released through the App Store.[22]
	</p>
	<p>
		In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding from a variety of
		investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[23]
		The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million.[24] In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million from venture
		capitalists with a $500 million valuation.[25] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's
		Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to
		Facebook.[26]
	</p>
	<h4>
		2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook
	</h4>
	<p>
		On April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[27][28] and it was downloaded more
		than one million times in less than one day.[29] The Android app has since received two significant updates:
		first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[30][31]
		then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an
		Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users
		were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement,
		Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were "exploring an
		iOS version".[32][33][34]
	</p>
	<p>
		On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock,[35][36][37] with a plan to
		keep the company independently managed.[38][39][40] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August
		14, 2012,[41] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation,
		allowing the deal to proceed.[42] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially
		closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[43]
	</p>
	<p>
		The deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN.[40] The deal price
		was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[40] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was "committed
		to building and growing Instagram independently."[40] According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400
		million.[44]
	</p>
	<p>
		In November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with
		limited functionality,[45] as well as a selection of badges, web widget buttons to link to profiles.[46]
	</p>
	<p>
		Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March
		2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.[47][48]
	</p>
	<h4>
		2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app
	</h4>
	<p>
		In June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with
		more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website.[49][50][51]
		Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The slideshow
		banner[52][53] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures
		posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In addition, the
		formerly angular profile pictures became circular.
	</p>
	<p>
		In April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app, after years of demand from Microsoft and the public
		to release an app for the platform.[54][55] The platform previously had a beta version of Instagram, first
		released on November 21, 2013, for Windows Phone 8.[56][57][58] The new app added support for videos (viewing
		and creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and direct messages.[59] Similarly, an app
		for Windows 10 personal computers and tablets was released in October 2016.[60][61] In May, Instagram updated
		its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a "lightweight" version of the Explore
		tab.[62][63]
	</p>
	<p>
		On May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design theme for the app's user
		interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more abstract, "modern" and colorful icon.[64][65][66] Rumors of a
		redesign first started circulating in April, when The Verge received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the
		time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept.[67]
	</p>
	<p>
		On December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a
		comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally
		decide to deactivate comments on a post.[68][69][70]
	</p>
	<p>
		The mobile web front end allows uploading pictures since May 4, 2017. Image filters and the ability to upload
		videos were not introduced then.[71][72]

	</p>
	<p>
		On April 30, 2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile website remains available as a
		progressive web application (PWA) with limited functionality. The app remains available on Windows 10 computers
		and tablets, also updated to a PWA in 2020.

	</p>
	<h4>
		2018–2019: IGTV, removal of the like counter, management changes
	</h4>
	<p>
		To comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users to
		download an archive of their user data in April 2018.[73][74][75]

		IGTV launched on June 20, 2018, as a standalone video application.

		On September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they would be stepping down from
		Instagram.[76][77] On October 1, 2018, it was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of
		Instagram.[78][79]
	</p>
	<p>
		During Facebook F8, it was announced that Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of
		publicly-displayed "like" counts for content posted by other users.[80] Like counts would only be visible to the
		user who originally posted the content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users "worry a little bit
		less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that
		they care about."[81][82] It has been argued that low numbers of likes in relativity to others could contribute
		to a lower self-esteem in users.[82][80] The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other markets in
		July.[82][83] The pilot was expanded worldwide in November 2019.[84] Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that
		it would implement new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the service.[85]
	</p>
	<p>
		In August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the "Following" tab from the app, which had allowed
		users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in
		October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused and that some users were
		"surprised" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner.[86][87]
	</p>
	<p>
		In October 2019, Instagram introduced a limit on the number of posts visible in page scrolling mode unless
		logged in. Until this point, public profiles had been available to all users, even when not logged in. Following
		the change, after viewing a number of posts a pop-up requires the user to log in to continue viewing
		content.[88][89][90]
	</p>
	<h4>
		2020–present: New features
	</h4>
	<p>
		In March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called "Co-Watching". The new feature allows users to share
		posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in
		order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result
		of the COVID-19 pandemic.[91]
	</p>
	<p>
		In August 2020, Instagram began a pivot to video, introducing a new feature called "Reels".[92][93][94] The
		intent was to compete with the video-sharing site TikTok.[94][95][92] Instagram also added suggested posts in
		August 2020. After scrolling through posts from the past 48 hours, Instagram displays posts related to their
		interests from accounts they do not follow.[96]
	</p>
	<p>
		In February 2021, Instagram began testing a new feature called Vertical Stories, said by some sources to be
		inspired by TikTok.[97] The same month, they also began testing the removal of ability to share feed posts to
		stories.[98]
	</p>
	<p>
		In March 2021, Instagram launched a new feature in which four people can go live at once.[99] Instagram also
		announced that adults would not be allowed to message teens who don't follow them as part of a series of new
		child safety policies.[100][101][102][103]
	</p>
	<p>
		In May 2021, Instagram began allowing users in some regions to add pronouns to their profile page.[104][105]
	</p>
	<p>
		On October 4, 2021, Facebook had its worst outage since 2008. The outage also affected other platforms owned by
		Facebook, such as Instagram and WhatsApp.[106][107] Security experts identified the problem as possibly being
		DNS-related.[108]
	</p>
	<p>
		On March 17, 2022, Zuckerberg confirmed plans to add non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the platform.[109]
