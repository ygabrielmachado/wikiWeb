	<h4> Depression</h4>
	<p>
		Khodarahimi & Fathi 2017 found evidence for Instagram users displaying higher levels of depressive
		symptoms.[289] Frison & Eggermont 2017 pointed out that only Instagram browsing, and not Instagram liking nor
		posting, predicts more depressive symptoms.[290] It also provides evidence for a relation between Instagram use
		and depressive symptomatology in the opposite direction, where level of depressed mood has shown to positively
		predict Instagram posting. Lamp et al. 2019 showed a positive relationship between depression and the number of
		selfies taken before posting it on Instagram.[291] What's more, more frequent Instagram use has negative
		associations for people who follow more strangers, but positive associations for people who follow fewer
		strangers, with social comparison and depressive symptoms.[292]
	</p>
	<h4>
		Anxiety
	</h4>
	<p>
		Khodarahimi & Fathi 2017 observed higher levels of anxiety in Instagram users compared to non-users,[289] while
		Mackson et al. 2019 suggested beneficial effects of Instagram use on anxiety symptoms.[293] Multiple studies
		pointed out small to moderate positive relationships between time spent on Instagram and trait anxiety, physical
		appearance anxiety, social anxiety and attention to high insecurity-eliciting body regions.[294][295][296][297]
		Moujaes & Verrier 2020 observed a connection between anxiety and online engagement with InstaMums, which
		relationship was influenced by social comparison orientation and self-esteem.[298]
	</p>
	<h4>
		Stress
	</h4>
	<p>
		A paper showed that users who feel that they spend too much time on Instagram report higher levels of addiction
		to Instagram, which in turn was related to higher self-reported levels of stress induced by the app.[299][300]
	</p>
	<h4>
		Addiction
	</h4>
	<p>
		In a study focusing on the relationship between various psychological needs and addiction to Instagram by
		students, Foroughi et al. 2021 found that the desire for recognition and entertainment were predictors of
		students' addiction to Instagram. In addition, the study proved that addiction to Instagram negatively affects
		academic performance.[301] Gezgin & Mihci 2020 quantified Turkish students' Instagram use's contribution to
		overall smartphone addiction, and concluded that frequent Instagram usage correlates with smartphone
		addiction.[302]
	</p>
	<h4>
		Harmful effect on teenage girls' mental health
	</h4>
	<p>
		Facebook has known for years that its Instagram app is harmful to a number of teenagers, according to research
		seen by The Wall Street Journal, but the company concealed the knowledge from lawmakers.[303]

		One study found that introduction to celebrity and peer pictures expanded women's negative mood.[304]

		Internal Facebook presentations seen by the Journal in 2021 show that Instagram is toxic to a sizable percentage
		of its users, particularly teenage girls. More than 40% of Instagram's users are under 23 years old. The
		presentations were seen by the company's executives and the findings mentioned to Mark Zuckerberg in 2020, but
		when asked in March 2021 about Instagram's effect on young people, Zuckerberg defended the company's plan to
		launch an Instagram product for children under 13.[303]

		When asked by senators for its internal findings on the impact of Instagram on youth mental health, Facebook
		sent a six-page letter but did not include the company's research. The company told Forbes that its research is
		"kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally."[305]

		In a blog post, Instagram said that the WSJ story "focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a
		negative light."[306]

		On September 27, 2021, weeks after the WSJ report was released, Facebook announced it had "paused" development
		of Instagram Kids, the Instagram product aimed at children. The company stated it was looking into concerns
		raised by the regulators and parents. Adam Mosseri stated that the company would return to the project as "[t]he
		reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed
		specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today."[307][308]
	</p>
	<h4>
		Satisfaction with appearance
	</h4>
	<p>
		Sherlock & Wagstaff 2019 showed that both the number of followers and followees show a small positive
		relationship with trait anxiety.[296] Instagram users report higher body surveillance,[309] appearance related
		pressure,[310] eating pathology[311] and lower body satisfaction[311] than non-users.[300] Multiple studies have
		shown that users who take more selfies (before posting) and strategically present themselves on Instagram, for
		example by editing or manipulating selfies, report higher levels of body surveillance, body dissatisfaction, and
		lower body esteem.[312][291][313][300] Tiggemann et al. 2020 also confirmed this through experimental study,
		finding that taking and editing selfies led to higher facial dissatisfaction.[314][300]
