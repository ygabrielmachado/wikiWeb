	<h2>System</h2>
	<h3>Definition of the System</h3>
	<p>
		Instagram is written in Python.

		Instagram artificial intelligence (AI) describes content for visually impaired people that use screen
		readers
	</p>
	<p>
		We need to clarify the goal of the system. System design is such a vast topic; if we don’t narrow it down to a
		specific purpose, it will become complicated to design the system, especially for newbies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instagram is a photo-sharing service that enables its users to upload and share their photos and videos with
		other users, mostly their followers. As this is an exercise, we will design a simpler version of the main
		Instagram service.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this service, a user can share photos and follow other users. There will be a newsfeed for each user. The
		‘News Feed’ consists of top photos of all the people the user follows.
	</p>
	<h3>Requirements of The System </h3>
	<p>
		In this part, we select the features of the system. The system requirements are divided into two parts:
	</p>
	<h3>
		Functional Requirements:
	</h3>
	<p>
		This type of requirement what the system has to deliver. You may say it is the main goal of the system.
		Firstly, for Instagram, the users should be able to upload/download/view photos. Users may perform searches for
		images based on photo/video titles. One User can follow other users. Another essential feature is that the
		system should display a user’s News Feed that consists of photos of all the people the user follows.
		As this is a practice for the system, we are not considering tags in photos, tag-based search, like and comment
		features, etc.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Availability and Reliability
	</h3>
	<p>
		We can not lose the photos uploaded by the users. Reliability is a huge factor for this system. So, we need to
		have more than one copy of each file. In that case, if one server is dead, we still have other copies of those
		photos.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can not have a single point of failure in a system. If we keep multiple copies of a component, it may remove
		the single point of failure in the system. For making a highly available system, we need to keep multiple
		replicas of the services in the system. So, even if some of the servers are down, the system may remain
		available. Creating redundancy in a system also provides a backup in a crisis.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Scalability
	</h3>
	<p>
		For supporting millions of users, we need to partition our database to divide and store our data into different
		DB servers. We can use database sharding for metadata.
