	<h3>Features and Tools</h3>
	<p>
		Users can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds,[110] and geotag images with the name
		of a location.[111] Users can set their account as "private", thereby requiring that they approve any new
		follower requests.[112] Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling
		them to share uploaded photos to those sites.[113] In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and
		live filters, instant tiltâ€“shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an
		updated icon.[114][115] Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the
		app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well.[116][117][118] Users could formerly view a map of a
		user's geotagged photos. The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage.[119][120]
	</p>
	<p>
		Since December 2016, posts can be "saved" into a private area of the app.[121][122] The feature was updated in
		April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into named collections.[123][124] Users can also "archive" their
		posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to
		prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of "likes" or are deemed boring, but also
		as a way to limit the "emergent behavior" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content.[125][126]
		In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily
		interact with replies.[127][128]
	</p>
	<p>
		Since February 2017, up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post, with the content appearing
		as a swipeable carousel.[129][130] The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an
		update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead.[131][132]

		In April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called "focus mode," which gently blurs the
		background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected.[133] In November, Instagram
		began to support Alt text to add descriptions of photos for the visually impaired. They are either generated
		automatically using object recognition (using existing Facebook technology) or manually specified by the
		uploader.[134]
