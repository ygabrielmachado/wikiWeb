		Instagram

	<p>
		Instagram[a] is a photo and video sharing social networking service founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike
		Krieger, and later acquired by American company Facebook Inc., now known as Meta Platforms. The app allows users
		to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be
		shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tag and location, view
		trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[10]

		Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of
		640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restrictions was eased with an
		increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a
		single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their
		content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is
		used by 500 million people daily.[10]

		Originally launched for iOS in October 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered
		users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by June 2018.[11] In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired
		the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012,
		followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for
		Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired
		for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health,
		its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by
		users.
